# Admin Panel Example

This example demonstrates how to track all registered users with `AdminDO` and expose a simple endpoint to list them.

## Usage

1. Run `wrangler dev` inside this folder.
2. Sign up users using the built-in `/api/signup` route.
3. Visit `/admin/users` to see all registered emails.
