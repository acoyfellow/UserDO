# Organizations Example

A team project management system built with UserDO, demonstrating organization-scoped data, member management, and multi-level business logic.

## What This Example Demonstrates

This is a team collaboration app that shows how UserDO's built-in organization features enable multi-user applications.

### Core Features

- Organizations: Create and manage teams/companies
- Projects: Organization-scoped project management  
- Tasks: Project-specific task tracking with assignments
- Member Management: Invite users, assign roles (Owner/Admin/Member)
- Access Control: Permission checking across all levels
- Real-time Updates: Live collaboration via WebSocket

### Architecture Overview

```
Users
  ↓
Organizations (Owner/Admin/Member roles)
  ↓  
Projects (organization-scoped)
  ↓
Tasks (project-scoped, assignable to members)
```

## Key UserDO Features Showcased

### 1. Built-in Organization Management
```ts
// Organization CRUD operations
await teamDO.createOrganization(name);
await teamDO.getOrganizations(); // Returns owned + member orgs
await teamDO.addOrganizationMember(orgId, email, role);
```

### 2. Organization-Scoped Data Tables
```ts
export class TeamDO extends UserDO {
  constructor(state: DurableObjectState, env: Env) {
    super(state, env);
    
    // Data automatically isolated per organization
    this.projects = this.table('projects', ProjectSchema, { organizationScoped: true });
    this.tasks = this.table('tasks', TaskSchema, { organizationScoped: true });
  }
}
```

### 3. Automatic Context Switching
```ts
async createProject(name: string, description: string, organizationId: string) {
  await this.getOrganization(organizationId); // Built-in access control
  this.setOrganizationContext(organizationId); // Switch data scope
  return await this.projects.create({ name, description }); // Auto-scoped
}
```

### 4. Cross-User Invitations
```ts
// Stores invitation in target user's UserDO
await teamDO.addOrganizationMember(orgId, 'newuser@example.com', 'member');

// Target user sees invitation when they log in
const { memberOrganizations } = await userDO.getOrganizations();
```

## Complete Web Interface

### Pages Included:
- Dashboard: Overview of owned/member organizations
- Organization Detail: Projects list, member management
- Project Detail: Tasks list, assignment management  
- Create Forms: New organizations, projects, tasks
- Member Management: Add/remove users, role assignment

### API Endpoints:
- Built-in Org Endpoints: `/api/organizations/*` (from UserDO)
- Project Endpoints: `/api/projects` (custom business logic)
- Task Endpoints: `/api/tasks` (custom business logic)
- Web Routes: Full navigation between all pages

## Code Structure

```
index.tsx (438 lines)
├── TeamDO class (60 lines) - Pure business logic
├── API endpoints (80 lines) - Project/task operations  
├── Web routes (200 lines) - Full navigation
└── Worker export (10 lines) - WebSocket + HTTP

frontend.tsx (506 lines)
├── 9 complete page components
├── Forms with validation
├── Role-based UI rendering
└── Navigation and styling
```

## Running the Example

```bash
# From repository root
cd examples/organizations
bun install
bun run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:8787` and:

1. Sign up as first user (becomes org owner)
2. Create organization "My Company"  
3. Add members with different roles
4. Create projects within the organization
5. Create tasks within projects, assign to members
6. Switch users to see role-based access control

## What Makes This Clean

### Before UserDO (Complex):
- 300+ lines of custom organization logic
- Manual invitation storage/retrieval
- Complex cross-user data access
- Custom access control implementation
- Manual context switching

### With UserDO (Clean):
- 60 lines of pure business logic in TeamDO
- Zero custom organization code needed
- Automatic invitation delivery
- Built-in access control
- Automatic data scoping

## Key Learning Points

1. Organization features are built-in - No custom implementation needed
2. Data scoping is automatic - Just use `{ organizationScoped: true }`
3. Member management works across users - Invitations are delivered automatically
4. Access control is handled - `getOrganization()` validates permissions
5. Business logic stays pure - Focus on projects/tasks, not org complexity

## Production Considerations

- Scalability: Each user gets their own Durable Object instance
- Security: Built-in role-based access control and data isolation  
- Real-time: WebSocket broadcasts for live collaboration
- Type Safety: Full TypeScript with Zod validation
- Error Handling: Graceful failures with user-friendly messages

This example shows that complex multi-user applications can be built with minimal code when the platform handles the hard parts.
