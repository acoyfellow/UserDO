# âœ… Organizations Added to UserDO

## What We Added (Minimal Changes)

âœ… **Organization Support** - Clean extension without breaking existing code
âœ… **Organization-Scoped Tables** - Tables can be shared within organizations  
âœ… **Member Management** - Add/remove members with roles (owner/admin/member)
âœ… **Permission System** - Role-based access control

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Extended TableOptions (1 line)
```ts
export interface TableOptions {
  userScoped?: boolean;
  organizationScoped?: boolean;  // <- Added this
  indexes?: string[];
}
```

### 2. Added Organization Context to Database (3 methods)
```ts
export class UserDODatabase {
  private organizationContext?: string;  // <- Added this
  
  setOrganizationContext(organizationId?: string): void {
    this.organizationContext = organizationId;
  }
}
```

### 3. Extended UserDO with Organization Methods (5 methods)
```ts
export class UserDO {
  // Organization context
  setOrganizationContext(organizationId?: string): void

  // Organization CRUD
  async createOrganization(name: string): Promise<{ organization: Organization }>
  async getOrganizations(): Promise<{ organizations: Organization[] }>
  async getOrganization(organizationId: string): Promise<{ organization: Organization; members: OrganizationMember[] }>
  
  // Member management
  async addOrganizationMember(organizationId: string, email: string, role: 'admin' | 'member'): Promise<{ member: OrganizationMember }>
  async removeOrganizationMember(organizationId: string, userId: string): Promise<{ ok: boolean }>
}
```

## How to Use

### 1. Basic Organization Operations
```ts
export class MyAppDO extends UserDO {
  constructor(state: DurableObjectState, env: Env) {
    super(state, env);
  }

  async setupTeam() {
    // Create organization
    const { organization } = await this.createOrganization('My Company');
    
    // Add team members
    await this.addOrganizationMember(organization.id, 'alice@company.com', 'admin');
    await this.addOrganizationMember(organization.id, 'bob@company.com', 'member');
    
    return organization;
  }
}
```

### 2. Organization-Scoped Tables
```ts
export class MyAppDO extends UserDO {
  // Personal data (user-scoped)
  personalNotes: any;
  
  // Team data (organization-scoped) 
  teamDocuments: any;

  constructor(state: DurableObjectState, env: Env) {
    super(state, env);
    
    this.personalNotes = this.table('personal_notes', NoteSchema, { 
      userScoped: true 
    });
    
    this.teamDocuments = this.table('team_documents', DocumentSchema, { 
      organizationScoped: true 
    });
  }

  async createTeamDocument(organizationId: string, title: string, content: string) {
    // Set organization context
    this.setOrganizationContext(organizationId);
    
    // Now all table operations are scoped to this organization
    const doc = await this.teamDocuments.create({ title, content });
    
    // Clear context
    this.setOrganizationContext(undefined);
    
    return doc;
  }
}
```

### 3. Data Isolation

**User-Scoped (existing)**
- Each user has their own isolated data
- `personalNotes.create()` only visible to that user

**Organization-Scoped (new)**
- Data shared within organization
- All organization members can see the data
- Still isolated from other organizations

## Architecture

```
User (Account Owner)
  â”œâ”€â”€ Personal Data (user-scoped tables)
  â””â”€â”€ Organizations (Teams/Companies)
      â”œâ”€â”€ Members (with roles: owner/admin/member)
      â””â”€â”€ Shared Data (organization-scoped tables)
```

## What Didn't Change

âœ… **All existing auth code** - signup, login, JWT, etc. unchanged
âœ… **All existing user-scoped tables** - still work exactly the same
âœ… **All existing APIs** - backward compatible
âœ… **Database structure** - just added optional `organization_id` column

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Minimal Code Changes** - Extended existing system instead of refactoring
2. **Backward Compatible** - All existing code still works
3. **Clean API** - Simple methods for common operations  
4. **Type Safe** - Full TypeScript support with Zod schemas
5. **Flexible** - Can have both personal and team data in same DO

## Ready to Use

The organization system is now fully functional and ready to use. You can:
- Create organizations
- Add/remove members  
- Create organization-scoped tables
- Switch between personal and team data contexts
- All with full type safety and real-time WebSocket updates

**No more complex refactoring needed!** ðŸŽ‰
