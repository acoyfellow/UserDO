Smart Document Chatbot - Sample Document

This is a sample document to demonstrate the capabilities of the Smart Document Chatbot built with Cloudflare Workers, TypeScript, and Effect.

Key Features:
- Document Upload: Users can upload text documents
- AI-Powered Chat: Ask questions about uploaded documents
- Vector Embeddings: Documents are converted to embeddings for semantic search
- RAG Implementation: Retrieval-Augmented Generation provides contextual responses
- Effect Integration: Functional programming patterns with comprehensive error handling

Technical Architecture:
The system uses Cloudflare Workers as the runtime environment, with R2 for document storage and Vectorize for embedding storage. The AI model used for embeddings is BGE-base-en-v1.5, which provides high-quality semantic representations of text.

Example Questions to Ask:
1. What are the key features of this chatbot?
2. How does the RAG implementation work?
3. What technologies are used in the architecture?
4. What AI model is used for embeddings?
5. Where are documents stored?

Usage Instructions:
1. Upload this document or any text file
2. Wait for processing to complete
3. Start asking questions about the content
4. The chatbot will provide answers based on the document content

This system demonstrates how modern AI can be integrated with edge computing platforms to create responsive, intelligent document processing systems.
